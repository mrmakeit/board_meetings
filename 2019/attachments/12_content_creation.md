# 2019-12-17 Content Creation Committee Report
## **Need more volunteers**

## Report from each [team/workgroup](https://github.com/techlahoma/broadcasting/blob/master/Teams/_Teams.md):

* A/V Automation
  * Got started on tools to more easily generate YouTube thumbnails from the Cloudinary account
  * Experimenting with video database again
    * First feature to focus on is updating meetup table nightly for streaming schedule
* Conference and Workshop A/V
  * Brent Beachler, Blixa Morgan, Chris Tse, and Kimberly Collins published the ThunderPlains videos on YouTube.
* Content Marketing
  * No updates. We would appreciate some help with marketing our content.
* Newscast
  * Alex Ayon, Chris Tse, Kimberly Collins, and Ryan Quinn have been taking turns creating weekly newscasts which highlight the meetups for the upcoming week.
  * There hasn't been much feedback to this point. Based on some feedback we've been looking for a cohost for the Tulsa newscasts, but no one has been able to commit to 40 minutes on every other Saturday.
  * The newscasts are on hiatus for December due to the holidays and the resulting low group activity. 
* Norman Streaming
  * The I-Hub has started telecasting their own events to Tulsa and OKC. 
  * They hope to train their staff to be stream volunteers for Techlahoma support too.
* OKC A/V Hardware
  * Made minor timing adjustments to make audio and video more in sync in streamed videos.
  * Working on purchasing a new microphone that will allow us to have louder audio and less noise in streamed videos.
* OKC A/V Volunteer Management
  * We have identified streamers and highlighters for all groups that stream meetups.
  * We are requiring two streamers and two highlighters for each group that requests streaming for 2020.
* OKC Streaming
  * Project 3810
    * Tried streaming but audio quality was very low. May try again at December meetup for OKC OSH .
  * StarSpace46
  * TBS Factoring
    * In light of a busier than average season and onboarding new team members, we were unable to schedule any new streaming events for TBS.  We are still very happy to do so in the future! 
* Tulsa Streaming
  * Due to unexpected changes in meeting locations for Tulsa Web Devs, streaming didn't work out as planned for November.
  * An equipment failure prior to Tulsa Lambda Lunch left us unable to stream this month.  Backup equipment is being procured to prevent issues in the future.
  * Need to discuss adding volunteers, and the process to get the equipment on-site.
* Twitch Channel Management
* Twitch Highlighting
* YouTube Channel Management
  * Updated thumbnails for many videos.
  * Views and viewing time have been increasing as we have been putting more efforts into improving the channel.
  * We're up to over 1230 subscribers and 650 videos.
